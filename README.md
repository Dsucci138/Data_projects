This repository are a combination of projectes completed and worked on by myself through various online learning programs to teach me more about data 
analytics along with preparing me for what may come. 

Along with a coursera certification, i've continued to learn more about Data analysis from many helpful websites and videos online which helped teach me:

* Gathering and Assessing Data
* Data Cleaning
* Data Exploration
* SQL for data analysis
* Tableau for data visualization
* Python for data analysis
